These steps worked with Python 3.9.2 on Debian 11 x86_64 kernel 5.10.

1. Install necessary system pkgs (list may not be exhaustive)
apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-venv build-essential

2. Install src
git clone git@github.com:cschwarze1/spins-b.git

3. Make a venv for spins-b (you can do this within any directory you like)
python3 -m venv spins-env

4. Modify spins-venv activation script to place spins-b module on path
echo export PYTHONPATH=~/path/to/spins-b:$PYTHONPATH >> ./spins-env/bin/activate

5. Activate venv. This must always be done before spins is used.
source ./spins-env/bin/activate

6. Install spins-b dependencies in the venv
(spins-env) $ pip3 install ./spins-b
(spins-env) $ pip3 install seaborn
(spins-env) $ pip3 install numpy==1.26 scipy==1.12.0

We need to explicitly downgrade some packages since some of the
trivial changes their devs made broke the spins library. Anyone
reading this is welcome to update this repo to use the latest version
of these packages.

If you find that spins is requiring other or older versions of
packages, please drop us a line!
